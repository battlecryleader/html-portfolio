<h1>The Best Movies According to Jonathan</h1>

<h2>Some of my top movies of all time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>

<p>This is my top movie of all time. I love it because it takes the superhero genre, which can be cheesy at times (especially with prior Batman movies) 
    and turns it into a serious drama. The movie has a very dark edge to it (which I like) and also deals with some very interesting moral 
    questions.


<h3>The Prestige</h3>

<p>Again, this movie has a slightly dark edge to it, but the main reason 
    why I love this film is because it is full of twists and turns. You never know 
    what will happen next!

<h3>Ocean's Eleven (2001)</h3>

<p>I always love movies that make you believe that one thing is happening, but in reality, 
    something else is occurring. The same thing happens with both The Prestige and Ocean's 
    Eleven, but the primary difference between the two is that Ocean's Eleven is a comedy. It 
    is also set in Las Vegas, which is my home.
